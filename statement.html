  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my website! My portfolio shows some of my digital media artwork that I've made during my time in college. <br>
    I used different ranges of media such as animation, photo, sound and video editing and many more.<br>
    Here are the programs that I've used in creating my portfolio: Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Audacity, Premiere Pro, Atom and Github.</br>
    These artwork that I created were inspired by my interest in using and combining different colors.
