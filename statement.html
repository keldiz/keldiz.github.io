  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <div class="line"></div>
  <p><br>Welcome to my website! My portfolio showcases some of the digital media artwork that I created in college using innovative and cutting edge technology. These work are inspired by my interest in complex combination of colors. One of the
    projects that I enjoyed creating the most was Mandala Art. To attain the overall effect, I had to utilize a variety of digital techniques that I learned to create geometric forms that exhibits repetition and symmetry. By applying my skills, a
    mundane photo was repurposed and recreated into a digital mosaic.<br>

    <br>My work begins with diligent planning and designing of different patterns and styles. After I gather everything together, I carefully compose these elements and design the final work. I find delight in the process of mixing, creating then
    executing work in the digital media world. I get excited in brainstorming and executing challenging work because it fulfills my desires to reveal the artist in me and I am continually looking for exciting mediums to experiment with and discover
    other artwork that I have never created before and see it come to life.<br>
