  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <div class="line"></div>
  <p>Welcome to my website! My portfolio shows some of my digital media artwork that I created during my time in college.
    I used different ranges of media such as animation, photo, sound and video editing and many more.
    Some of the programs that I used in creating my portfolio are: Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Audacity, Premiere Pro, Atom and Github.
    These artwork that I designed were inspired by my interest in using and combining different colors. An example of my work is my Mandala project. I used
     a photo I found online and manipulated it using Adobe Photoshop to create a unique art. I used a colorful photo to start with and utilized
      different software techniques to emphasize those colors.
