  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <div class="line"></div>
  <p>Welcome to my website! My portfolio shows some of my digital media artwork that I created during my time in college.
    I used different ranges of media such as animation, photo, sound and video editing and many more.
    Some of the programs that I used in creating my portfolio: Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Audacity, Premiere Pro, Atom and Github.
    These artwork that I designed were inspired by my interest in using and combining different colors.
